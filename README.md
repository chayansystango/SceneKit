# SceneKit
This is an app where you can try different view points on a 3D model of a property with a couple viewpoints in AR as well.

Just configure the code signing and run it on a device as you might get crashes on simulator due to some jpeg images. Also, you won't be able to get your hands on AR using a simulator. 

In 3D model you can try out 3 different views namely Floor Plan, Bird Eye and Person view.

In AR, you can try a Bird Eye view and a Person view. 
For better placements of the model try to find a textured surface or corners so that the camera can detect some feature points to place a model. In person view try to tap somewhere on the floor to get a view from a good height (eye level).

Pro Tip: try actually walking around after you place the model in Person view when on AR, you can inspect the property as if you are in it.
