# SceneKit
This is an app where you can try different view points on a 3D model of a property with a couple viewpoints in AR as well.

Just configure the code signing and run it on a device as you might get crashes on simulator due to some jpeg images. Also, you won't be able to get your hands on AR using a simulator.
